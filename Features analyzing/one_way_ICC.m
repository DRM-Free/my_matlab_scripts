function ICC=one_way_ICC(m)
%M is a vector of vector cells.
% The m vector single dimension must be consistent (ex : lesions)
% Data dimension in each cell is not meaningful (ex : ROI number) and thus an equal number
% of elements for each cell is not required

% The result ICC value reflects how consistent the values are among each
% groups. An ICC close 1 meaning that overall variations are linked mainly
%to groups, and an ICC closer to 0 gives more credits to individual
%variations regardless of group, thus reducing the discriminative impact of our
%studied feature in regard to the considered groups
