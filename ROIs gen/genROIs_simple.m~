function [all_simple_rois]= genROIs_simple(roi,range,nIter)
%range is the size of the area to be considered around each point for growth or shrink.
%threshold represents how easy it will be to grow or shrink. 0 will always
%grow, 1 will always shrink

%Those thersholds were chosen for a range of 5
% good_shrink_thresholds=[0.3,0.35,0.4,0.45,0.5]; %>0.5 can give unexpected behaviour, sometimes overshrink and matrix becomes 0
good_shrink_thresholds=[0.3,0.325,0.35,0.4,0.42,0.5,0.55]; %>0.5 can give unexpected behaviour, sometimes overshrink and matrix becomes 0
%<0.3 for shrink actually becomes an expand
% good_expand_thresholds=[0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25]; %>0.3 is actually a shrink
